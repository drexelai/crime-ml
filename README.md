# crime-ml

We show that using time and location based features along with deep neural nets and transformers provide superior model performance compared to state of the art for Crime Prediction with 40% improvements of 5-10% higher accuracies.

Our code is in `Crime ML.ipynb` where you can see all the data preprocessing and machine learning parameters we used to replicate our results.

We obtained our data from [OpenDataPhilly](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/crime-incidents/) and the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAPHIL5URN)
